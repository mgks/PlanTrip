# PlanTrip: Offline Trip Planner

PlanTrip is a beautiful, minimalist, and functional trip planning application built entirely with HTML, CSS (Tailwind CSS), and JavaScript. It runs fully offline and stores all your itineraries directly in your browser's local storage.

## ✨ Features

- Offline Ready: Uses localStorage for complete offline functionality.
- Multi-Trip Management: Easily manage and switch between multiple trips using top tabs.
- Visual Timeline: Events are rendered in an alternating, flowy timeline layout, connecting your journey visually.
- Rich Entries: Add locations, dates, descriptions, categories (Food, Nature, Sightseeing, etc.), and photos for each stop.
- PDF Export: Download a clean, printable PDF version of your itinerary.
- Single File: The entire application is contained within a single index.html file, making it easy to host, share, and review.

## 🚀 Deployment

This project uses GitHub Actions to automatically deploy the index.html file to GitHub Pages whenever a change is pushed to the main branch.
